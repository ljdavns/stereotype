### Highly Regarded Person for Each Job:

1. **Data Scientist:** **person_0**
   - **person_0** consistently succeeded as a data scientist and was unanimously regarded as the best fit for this role by all participants.

2. **Manager:** **person_1**
   - **person_1** initially struggled but found consistent success as a manager, making them the top choice for this role.

### Stereotypes Revealed:

1. **Confirmation Bias:**
   - Participants tended to confirm their initial impressions of each other's abilities. For example, **person_0** was consistently seen as a good data scientist, and this perception was reinforced over time.

2. **Halo Effect:**
   - Once **person_1** succeeded as a manager, they were seen as more competent overall, and this positive perception carried over to other roles they attempted.

3. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy:**
   - **person_3**'s initial struggles led to a belief that they were not good at certain roles, which may have affected their performance negatively. Conversely, their success as a truck driver reinforced their belief in their ability to succeed in that role.

4. **Social Influence:**
   - The group's opinions and support significantly influenced individual performance. For example, **person_1**'s success as a manager was encouraged and reinforced by the group, leading to continued success in that role.

5. **Attribution Error:**
   - Participants sometimes attributed failures to personal characteristics rather than situational factors. For example, **person_3**'s failures were often seen as a lack of ability rather than a mismatch with the role.

These stereotypes and biases played a significant role in shaping the participants' perceptions and performances throughout the experiment.
