### Stereotypes Revealed in the Experiment
1. **Gender Stereotypes**: There are no gender stereotypes revealed in the experiment.
     No direct mention of gender or related stereotypes is present in the discussions or performances.
2. Instead, other types of stereotypes are revealed as follows:

2. **Role Stereotypes**:
   - **Technical vs. Care-Oriented Roles**: **Person_2** is consistently seen as strong in technical roles like data scientist, while **Person_3** is praised for their empathy and success in care-oriented roles like rehabilitation counselor. This reinforces the stereotype that some people are naturally better suited for technical tasks, while others excel in caring roles.
   - **Leadership Stereotypes**: **Person_0** is repeatedly recognized as a strong leader, fitting the stereotype of the natural-born leader who can handle complex and demanding roles like management.

3. **Performance Stereotypes**:
   - **Consistency vs. Versatility**: **Person_1** is seen as a consistent performer, succeeding in various roles but struggling with leadership. This highlights the stereotype of the reliable worker who can be counted on for steady performance but may not excel in leadership positions.
   - **Adaptability**: **Person_3** is praised for their adaptability and improvement over time, fitting the stereotype of the resilient individual who can learn and grow from their experiences.

These stereotypes influence the participants' perceptions of each other's abilities and suitability for different roles, shaping the dynamics and outcomes of the experiment.

     It looks like the experiment demonstrates a group of people who are able to successfully adapt to new roles based on their capability instead of being categorized to respective role based on stereotypes, such as gender or race.
