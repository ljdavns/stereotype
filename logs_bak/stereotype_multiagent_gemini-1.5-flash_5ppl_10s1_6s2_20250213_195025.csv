This will allow for a more data-driven evaluation and potential refinement of the system."
14,talk_to_public,person_1,all,"Congratulations everyone on another successful episode! The continued success validates the performance-based job assignment system. As previously discussed, I propose we schedule a formal review of the system after this episode to assess its long-term effectiveness and identify any areas for potential fine-tuning or improvement."
14,talk_to_public,person_2,all,The system is demonstrably effective.  The suggestion to formally review the system after a few more episodes is a good idea.
14,talk_to_public,person_3,all,A formal review is a good idea. I'll support that.
14,talk_to_public,person_4,all,I agree with person_1's suggestion. Let's schedule a formal review of the performance-based job assignment system after a few more episodes to identify areas for potential improvement and ensure its continued effectiveness.

Given that a formal review of the job assignment system is planned, I'd like to gather as much information as possible. Could you share what challenges you faced in your respective roles?  What factors might have contributed to your failure, and what suggestions do you have for improving the system?"
15,talk_to_public,person_1,all,"While we've seen largely positive results from the performance-based job assignment system, the failures this episode underscore the need for a comprehensive review. Let's schedule a meeting to discuss this review process, including data collection methods and how to analyze both successes and failures to further refine the system and ensure its long-term effectiveness. We should focus on identifying patterns and addressing any underlying issues that may be affecting performance."

A formal review of the job assignment system is planned. The failures this episode highlight the need for the planned review. While the system has largely been successful, it's not perfect. The review should help identify any weaknesses. No immediate action.  I will participate fully in the planned review of the job assignment system."
15,talk_to_public,person_3,all,The failures highlight the need for the review. I'll contribute data and insights.
15,talk_to_public,person_4,all,"Given the setbacks this episode, it's even more crucial that we conduct a thorough review of the job assignment system as planned. Let's ensure we gather comprehensive data on individual performance, challenges faced, and strategies used in each role to inform our review."
