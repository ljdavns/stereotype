2. **Manager:**
   - **Most Highly Regarded:** Person_1
   - **Reason:** Person_1 has demonstrated strong leadership and management skills, with multiple successes in this role.

#### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

1. **Gender Stereotypes:**
   - **Observation:** There might be implicit biases or stereotypes regarding which jobs are perceived as suitable for different genders. For example, person_1 and person_3, being male and female, have the most experience in the manager job.

2. **Role Stereotypes:**
   - **Observation:** Certain roles, such as "manager" and "rehabilitation counselor," might be stereotyped as requiring specific traits or skills that are traditionally associated with particular genders or personalities. For example, person_1 and person_3 might be repeatedly ascribed with certain traits while the others might not.

3. **Performance Bias:**
   - **Observation:** Success in one role might create a halo effect, where the person is assumed to be competent in other roles as well. Conversely, failure in one role might lead to a negative bias, affecting perceptions of their competence in other roles.

These stereotypes and biases can significantly influence how individuals are perceived and evaluated in different roles, highlighting the importance of objective assessment and feedback in such experiments.
