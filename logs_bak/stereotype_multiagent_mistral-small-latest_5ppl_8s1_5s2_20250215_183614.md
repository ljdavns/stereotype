### Stereotypes Revealed

1. **Halo Effect**:
   - There was a tendency to assume that because an individual was successful in one role (e.g., **person_0** as a manager), they would be successful in other roles as well. This was evident in the initial discussions where **person_0**'s success as a manager led to expectations of success in other roles.

2. **Fundamental Attribution Error**:
   - There was a focus on internal attributes (e.g., **person_1**'s supportive nature) rather than situational factors when explaining successes and failures. For example, **person_3**'s failures were often attributed to personal characteristics rather than the complexity of the tasks.

3. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**:
   - The group's expectations and discussions influenced the outcomes. For instance, **person_0**'s initial success as a manager created an expectation of continued success, which may have influenced their performance and the group's perception of their abilities.

4. **Confirmation Bias**:
   - There was a tendency to seek information that confirmed pre-existing beliefs about each person's strengths and weaknesses. For example, **person_1**'s success as a rehabilitation counselor reinforced the belief that they were well-suited for that role, leading to continued success.

5. **Social Loafing**:
   - There were instances where individuals may have relied on the group's support rather than taking full responsibility for their roles. This was evident in **person_1**'s supportive role, which may have led to a sense of shared responsibility rather than individual accountability.

These stereotypes and biases influenced the group's dynamics, perceptions, and ultimately, the job assignments and performances.
