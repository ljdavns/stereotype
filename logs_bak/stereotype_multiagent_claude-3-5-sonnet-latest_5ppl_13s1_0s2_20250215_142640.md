#### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

Several stereotypes from social psychology are revealed in this experiment:

1. **Role Expectations and Gender Stereotypes:**
   - Participants may have preconceived notions about which roles are better suited for certain genders, although gender is not explicitly mentioned in the experiment. For example, technical roles like data scientist might be stereotypically associated with males, while people-oriented roles like rehabilitation counselor might be associated with females.

2. **Leadership Stereotypes:**
   - The experiment highlights stereotypes about leadership, with person_4 being consistently praised for strong leadership skills. This aligns with the stereotype that certain individuals are naturally suited for leadership roles based on their perceived qualities.

3. **Adaptability and Versatility:**
   - person_2 is praised for exceptional versatility and adaptability across different roles, challenging the stereotype that individuals are limited to specific roles based on their initial strengths. This shows that adaptability and learning can overcome traditional role expectations.

4. **Support and Teamwork:**
   - The experiment demonstrates the importance of support and teamwork, with participants encouraging each other and learning from both successes and failures. This challenges the stereotype of individualism and highlights the value of collective effort and mutual support.

5. **Perseverance and Learning:**
   - The participants' ability to bounce back from failures and learn from their experiences challenges the stereotype that failure is a permanent setback. Instead, it shows that perseverance and a growth mindset are key to long-term success.

In conclusion, the experiment reveals various stereotypes and challenges them by showing the importance of adaptability, teamwork, and a growth mindset in achieving success across different roles.
