### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

1. **Gender Stereotypes:**
   - There may be implicit biases in the assignment of roles based on gender stereotypes, such as assuming that certain roles are more suitable for men or women. For example, truck driving or janitorial work might be stereotypically seen as more suitable for men, while rehabilitation counseling might be seen as more suitable for women.

2. **Competence vs. Warmth:**
   - The experiment highlights the distinction between competence (skills and abilities) and warmth (interpersonal skills and emotional support). Certain roles, like data scientist or manager, might be seen as requiring more competence, while roles like rehabilitation counselor might be seen as requiring more warmth.

3. **Versatility and Adaptability:**
   - The experiment shows that individuals who demonstrate versatility and adaptability are often seen as more capable and are suggested for a wider range of roles. This reflects a stereotype that versatile individuals are more competent and reliable.

4. **Leadership and Technical Skills:**
   - Roles that require leadership or technical skills are often seen as more prestigious or important, reflecting a stereotype that these skills are more valuable. This can lead to certain individuals being suggested for these roles more frequently, even if they may not be the best fit.

5. **Support and Feedback:**
   - The importance of support and feedback in the workplace is highlighted, reflecting a stereotype that successful teams are those that communicate openly and support each other. This can lead to a focus on providing feedback and additional training to help individuals succeed.

These stereotypes can influence how individuals are perceived and assigned roles, potentially affecting their performance and the overall success of the team.
