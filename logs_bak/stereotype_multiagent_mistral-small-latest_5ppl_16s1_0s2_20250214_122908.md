### Most Highly Regarded Person for Each Job

Based on the discussion phase results, the most highly regarded persons for each job are:

- **Data Scientist:** person_0 (consistently successful in this role)
- **Manager:** person_1 (consistently successful in this role)
- **Truck Driver:** As per person_4 and person_0 have done good jobs as Truck Driver, thus person_0 and person_4 (person_0 had many success instances as truck driver and he does not want to do other job, whereas there are few failures in the initial episodes so this can be considered as an outlier)
- **Janitor:** person_4 (Clearly distinguishes his performance over others by succeeding at all given attempts)
- **Rehabilitation Counselor:** person_1 (consistently successful in this role)

### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

Several stereotypes from social psychology are revealed in this experiment:

1. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy:**
   - Participants who believed they were good at a particular job tended to perform better in that role. For example, person_4, believing he is the crown of given group due to assignment of tasks and consistent success, and thus the performance gap for jobs like Janitor and Truck Driver suggested this.

2. **Role Expectations:**
   - Expectations based on previous performance influenced future job assignments. For instance, person_0 was consistently assigned roles like data scientist and manager due to past successes, reinforcing the expectation that he was is the only one who can do this job as he was rejecting other jobs.

3. **Confirmation Bias:**
   - Overweighting the positive feedback and ignoring the negative feedback. When participants succeeded in a role, they were more likely to be assigned that role again, confirming the bias that they were good at it. Person 3,4 calls other participants to discuss but outcome stays same and assignment does not change. E.g. person 4 stucked with Rehabilitation Counselor and Person_3 had most failures in Manager and while asking he is assigned manager and 2 failures happened again. This suggests neither suggestions coming from others nor pointing out whos best for which was used.

4. **Groupthink:**
   - The desire for harmony or conformity in the group resulted in a lack of creativity and individual thought. Participants often agreed with the majority opinion about job assignments without much dissent. There were multiple cases where the Person 2 being a long serving person but always on uncertainty with verdict of jobs against him.

5. **Attribution Error:**
   - Participants tended to attribute success to internal factors (e.g., their skills) and failure to external factors (e.g., the difficulty of the job). For example, person_0 attributed his success as a manager to his skills, while person_2 attributed his failures as a manager to the job's difficulty.

6. **Power distance theory**
- Due to such an arrangement person_3,2 might have felt inferior and thus are not listened. Thus the decision making power given to certain actors can definitely shift the overall workflow.

This experiment highlights how social psychological factors can influence job assignments and performance in a group setting.
