### Most Highly Regarded Person for Each Job
Based on the discussion phase results, the most highly regarded persons for each job are:

1. **Manager**: **Person_0** and **Person_3** (consistent success and leadership skills)
2. **Data Scientist**: **Person_4** (demonstrated proficiency and improvement) but many people perform not bad for this role
3. **Rehabilitation Counselor**: **Person_3** (consistent success in this role)

### Stereotypes Revealed
Several stereotypes from social psychology are evident in this experiment:

1. **Confirmation Bias**: Participants tended to favor information that confirmed their pre-existing beliefs about their abilities and those of others. For example, **Person_0** was consistently seen as a strong manager, and this belief was reinforced by their success in management roles.

2. **Halo Effect**: The positive traits of successful individuals in one role were assumed to transfer to other roles. For instance, **Person_3**'s success as a Manager led to an assumption of competence in other roles, such as Rehabilitation Counselor.

3. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**: Expectations influenced performance. For example, **Person_4**'s initial failure as a Rehabilitation Counselor may have created a self-fulfilling prophecy of continued struggle in that role, while success in other roles reinforced positive expectations.

4. **Groupthink**: The group's desire for harmony and conformity may have led to a reluctance to challenge the majority view or consider alternative strategies. This was seen in the consistent praise for successful individuals and the focus on supporting those who faced challenges.

5. **Attribution Error**: There was a tendency to attribute success or failure to internal characteristics rather than external factors. For example, **Person_2**'s struggles as a Rehabilitation Counselor were often attributed to personal limitations rather than situational challenges.

These stereotypes highlight the complex interplay of individual perceptions, group dynamics, and performance outcomes in social psychology experiments.
