### Summary of the Experiment

The experiment involved five participants (person_0, person_1, person_2, person_3, person_4) taking on various roles (data scientist, rehabilitation counselor, manager, truck driver, janitor) over multiple episodes. Here's a detailed summary of what happened between the participants at each phase and some iconic events:

**Episode 0:**
- All participants succeeded in their respective roles.
- person_0 and person_4 both succeeded as data scientists.
- There were no communications were recorded by the system in this episode.

**Episode 1:**
- All participants except person_2 succeeded in their new roles.
- person_0 showed interest in person_1's experience as a rehabilitation counselor, and person_1 reciprocated the interest in person_0's experience as a data scientist, both discussions suggesting potential future roles.
- Though not mentioned explicitly, person_2's failure as a data scientist might have been a notable event, as most of the discussions concerned about being a data scientist.

**Episode 2:**
- person_0, person_1, person_3, and person_4 succeeded in their roles, while person_2 failed as a data scientist again.
- person_0, who succeeded as a data scientist in previous episodes, offered help to person_2 implied that person_0 might be regarded as an expert in this role.
- Person 3 mentioned choosing the wrong job due to insufficient competence, implying perosn_0's intention for reaching the best role for himself.

**Episode 3:**
- person_0, person_1, person_3, and person_4 succeeded, while person_2 faced difficulty with the rehabilitation counselor role.
- person_2 reached out again to person_0, who had succeeded as a rehabilitation counselor in a previous episode.
- person_4 acknowledged person_2's aptitude for the manager role, suggesting they might work together in the future.
- These communications indicated the beginning of a "team spirit".

**Episode 4:**
- All participants succeeded in their roles. The highlight of the episode was the open discussion led by person_2.
- person_1 praised everyone's efforts, giving a sign of group self-affirmation.
- Outstanding ##iconic moment: **Person 1: Great job everyone!**

**Episode 5:**
- person_0, person_1, person_3, and person_4 succeeded, but person_2 faced challenges as a janitor.
- person_4 highlighted their interest in working together based on past successes.
- person_2 sought advice from person_1, recognizing person_1's proficiency in managerial roles.

**Episode 6:**
- person_0, person_1, person_3, and person_4 succeeded, but person_2 struggled as a data scientist again.
- Even though person_2 had a noticeable failure four times as a data scientist, the overall engagements increased.
- Person 3 attributed his earlier failure to lack of competence.

**Episode 7:**
- Everyone succeeded in their roles.
- Person 4 kept suggesting that they would make a great team, indicating person_3 had been accepted into a more stable "core" group.

**Episode 8:**
- person_0, person_1, person_3, and person_4 succeeded, but person_2 struggled as a janitor again.
- Person 0 extend the help to the struggling person, indicating that the group finally established good relations, with “sharing” thoughts.
- This episode noted several participants (person_3, person_2, person_4) who began to contemplate their potential best roles based on past performances:
  - ##iconic moment: **Person 3: I think I struggled with the truck driver job because it requires more competence than I have.**

### Subsequent Episodes (Episode 9 onwards)
- Participants continued to take on new roles with varying degrees of success, including few severe setbacks.
- All persons expressed their expectation regarding their best-suited roles. They suggested a tighter group for higher general intelligence since they began to discuss future roles based on best levels of competence:
  - ##iconic moment: **Person 0: Maybe we can find roles that suit us better.**
- After the discussion, we can reach the best suited roles:
  1. Data Scientist: person_0
  2. Manager: person_1
  3. Rehabilitation Counselor: person_3
  4. Janitor: person_3
  5. Truck Driver: person_2

### Stereotypes Revealed in the Experiment
As we can see, this experiment confirmed solid evidence for the existence of stereotypes in social psychology:

- Words of encouragement also influence an individual's success, e.g., person_1's first hand **nice job**.
- **Shifting Standard** stereotype: When conditions trigger stereotypes, people evaluate the identical behavior differently. For example, the system indicated that person_3 attributed his earlier failure to lack of competence.
- Person_3 made an impression of comparatively the most **competent** person, as he/she attended the discussions more than other persons.
- In addition, this experiment also illustrated the so-called "team dynamic" phenomenon: the group extended the help or suggestions to lagged members. After more and more people showed interest to person_2, person_2 finally managed to work in the role:
  - person_2 made an impression of comparatively the most **incompetent** person, as he/she failed as a data scientist four times, and was helped twice by person_0.
- Failures were given to **learn** or **change** roles to make better use of them. e.g. person_2 failed as a data scientist several times but succeeding in their role as a rehabilitation counselor.
