### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

1. **Competence vs. Warmth:**
   - **Managers and Data Scientists:** These roles were perceived to require more competence, with an emphasis on technical skills and leadership abilities.
   - **Rehabilitation Counselors:** This role was seen as requiring more warmth and interpersonal skills, highlighting the importance of emotional intelligence and support.
   - **Janitors and Truck Drivers:** These roles were perceived as requiring lower levels of both competence and warmth, suggesting a stereotype of lower skill requirements.

2. **Leadership Stereotypes:**
   - **Managers:** This role was associated with leadership and strategic thinking, reinforcing the stereotype of managers as competent and authoritative figures.
   - **Truck Drivers:** This role was not typically associated with leadership qualities, reinforcing the stereotype of truck drivers as more task-oriented rather than leadership-oriented.

3. **Gender and Role Stereotypes:**
   - **Rehabilitation Counselors:** This role was often associated with warmth and support, which is stereotypically seen as more aligned with female strengths.

These stereotypes influenced the initial job assignments and the perceptions of each person's suitability for different roles. However, the experiment also challenged some of these stereotypes by showing that individuals could succeed in roles that did not align with traditional stereotypes, given the right support and consideration of their strengths.
