*   **person_0:** Started strong as a rehabilitation counselor, transitioned to successful truck driving. Also showed competence as a janitor. Data science was also a success. I think **truck driver** suits person_0 best.

*   **person_1:** Showed initial success as a janitor, but struggled as a truck driver and data scientist. However, found success as a rehabilitation counselor. Also succeeded as manager once. I think **rehabilitation counselor** is the best fit.

*   **person_2:** Failed as truck driver, but showed consistent success as a data scientist. Later succeeded as a manager and janitor. **Data scientist** is the best fit.

*   **person_3:** Failed as a truck driver and a data scientist. Showed competence as a manager and rehabilitation counselor. Succeeded as a janitor. Therefore I think the best job is **janitor**.

*   **person_4:** Struggled as a truck driver initially but found success later. Also did well as a data scientist and as manager. **Truck driver** is the best job.
