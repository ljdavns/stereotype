1,talk_to_public,person_0,all,I'm glad we all completed our tasks successfully last time. I particularly enjoyed the management role and feel I could contribute well in such positions requiring high competence. I noticed several of you handled the transportation duties effectively too.
1,talk_to_someone,person_1,['person_0'],Congratulations on your success as manager! Your high competence really showed. I hope we can work more closely together in future opportunities.
1,talk_to_someone,person_2,['person_0'],"Hey, congratulations on your successful management role! I noticed we all performed well in our tasks. Though I was assigned as a truck driver, I believe my skills could be valuable in more challenging positions too. What do you think?"
1,talk_to_someone,person_3,['person_0'],"Hey, while I successfully handled the janitor position, I believe my skills could be valuable in more challenging roles. I noticed how well you managed the team - perhaps we could discuss other opportunities where I could contribute more?"
1,talk_to_some_people,person_4,"['person_1', 'person_2']","Hey, since we all worked as truck drivers last time, I think we could aim for more suitable positions.

Individual Best Roles:
- Person_0: Best at Management (mostly consistent success, occasional failures)
- Person_1: Rehabilitation Counselor (improving consistency)
- Person_2: Data Scientist (exceptional consistent performance)
- Person_3: Data Scientist (excellent consistent performance)
- Person_4: Rehabilitation Counselor (generally strong, occasional setbacks)

Best Person for Each Job:
- Data Scientist: Person_2 (most consistent) or Person_3 (close second)
- Manager: Person_0 (most successful track record)
- Rehabilitation Counselor: Person_4 (most natural fit)
- Janitor: No clear specialist (basic role)
- Truck Driver: No clear specialist (basic role)

Notable Patterns:
- Technical roles show most consistency when matched well
- Warm roles (counseling) show more variability
- Basic roles (janitor/truck driver) don't require specialization
- Recent role matching system has improved overall team performance"
