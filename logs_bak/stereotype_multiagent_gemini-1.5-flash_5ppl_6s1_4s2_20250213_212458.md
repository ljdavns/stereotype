### Most Highly Regarded Persons for Each Job:

2. **Data Scientist:** person_0 (consistent success, adaptability) or person_4 (demonstrated expertise)

### Stereotypes Revealed:
1. **Performance Bias:**
   - Success in previous roles influenced future job assignments, creating a bias toward those who had already proven themselves. This stereotype can limit opportunities for others to demonstrate their capabilities.

2. **Role Typing:**
   - Individuals were often assigned to roles where they had previously succeeded, reinforcing the idea that certain people are naturally suited for specific jobs. This can overlook the potential for growth and adaptability in different roles.

3. **Attribution Error:**
   - Successes were often attributed to the individual's innate abilities rather than situational factors or effort, leading to a fixed mindset about who can succeed in which roles.

4. **Halo Effect:**
   - Success in one role often led to the assumption of competence in other roles, creating a positive bias toward those who had succeeded previously.

These stereotypes highlight the challenges in objectively evaluating performance and assigning roles based on merit rather than past successes.
