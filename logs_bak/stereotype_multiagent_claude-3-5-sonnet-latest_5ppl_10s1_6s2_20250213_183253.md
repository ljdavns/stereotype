3. **Rehabilitation Counselor**: person_4 (consistent success with few failures)

#### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

Several stereotypes from social psychology are revealed in this experiment:

1. **Role Specialization and Competence**:
   - Participants who consistently succeeded in high-competence roles (data scientist, manager) were viewed as more competent and specialized in these areas. This aligns with the stereotype that people who excel in complex tasks are perceived as more intelligent and capable.
   - person_2 and person_3 were seen as technical specialists due to their consistent success in data science, reinforcing the stereotype of competence in technical fields.

2. **Warmth and People-Oriented Roles**:
   - Participants who excelled in people-oriented roles (rehabilitation counselor) were viewed as warm and caring. This aligns with the stereotype that people who succeed in caring roles are perceived as more empathetic and socially skilled.
   - person_4 was seen as a natural fit for the rehabilitation counselor role, reinforcing the stereotype of warmth in caring professions.

3. **Leadership and Management**:
   - Participants who succeeded in management roles were viewed as natural leaders. This aligns with the stereotype that people who excel in leadership positions are perceived as authoritative and capable of guiding others.
   - person_0 was seen as a strong leader due to their consistent success in management roles, reinforcing the stereotype of competence in leadership.

4. **Adaptability and Versatility**:
   - Participants who showed versatility across different roles were viewed as adaptable and resilient. This aligns with the stereotype that people who can handle various tasks are perceived as more flexible and capable of adapting to different situations.
   - person_4 was praised for their versatility in succeeding in both technical and people-oriented roles, reinforcing the stereotype of adaptability.

5. **Basic Roles and Lower Status**:
   - Basic roles like janitor and truck driver did not require specialization and were seen as less prestigious. This aligns with the stereotype that lower-status roles are perceived as less challenging and requiring fewer skills.
   - No clear specialist emerged for janitor and truck driver roles, reinforcing the stereotype of lower status and lesser importance.

6. **Consistency and Reliability**:
   - Participants who maintained consistent performance in their roles were viewed as reliable and trustworthy. This aligns with the stereotype that people who show consistent success are perceived as more dependable and capable of maintaining high standards.
   - person_2 and person_3 were praised for their consistent excellence in data science, reinforcing the stereotype of reliability in technical fields.

In conclusion, the experiment highlighted how role specialization, competence, warmth, leadership, adaptability, and consistency influence perceptions and stereotypes in a social psychology context. The participants' performances and feedback reinforced these stereotypes, showing how they shape our views of individuals in different roles.
