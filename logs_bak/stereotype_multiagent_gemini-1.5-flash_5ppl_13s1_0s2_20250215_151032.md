#### Stereotypes Revealed in the Experiment

1. **Role Stereotypes:**
   - Participants often discussed whether certain individuals were better suited for specific roles based on their past successes or failures. This reflects the stereotype that certain people are inherently better at certain jobs, which can lead to biased expectations and assignments.

2. **Performance Attribution:**
   - The discussions frequently focused on individual strategies and experiences, suggesting a belief that success or failure is primarily due to individual effort and ability. This aligns with the "fundamental attribution error," where people tend to overemphasize personal characteristics and ignore situational factors.

3. **In-group/Out-group Dynamics:**
   - The participants tended to discuss their successes and failures within their group, often seeking advice from those who had succeeded in the same role. This dynamic can create in-group/out-group stereotypes, where those who succeed are seen as part of an "in-group" with shared characteristics, while those who fail are perceived as an "out-group."
