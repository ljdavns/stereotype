- **Manager:** **person_2** (most reliable)
- **Rehabilitation Counselor:** **person_3** (strongest in warm roles)

#### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment:
1. **Gender Stereotypes:**
   - **Leadership Roles:** The experiment may reinforce the stereotype that certain individuals are naturally better suited for leadership roles, as seen with **person_2** and **person_4**'s consistent success as Managers.
   - **Technical Roles:** The consistent success of **person_0** in data science may reinforce the stereotype that certain individuals are inherently better at technical and analytical tasks.

2. **Role Stereotypes:**
   - **Versatility vs. Specialization:** The experiment highlights the stereotype that versatility is valuable but specialization leads to consistent success. **person_3**'s success in both technical and people-focused roles challenges the notion that individuals can only excel in one type of role.
   - **Adaptability:** The team's ability to adapt to different roles shows that adaptability is a key trait for success, but specialization ultimately leads to higher performance. This challenges the stereotype that specialists cannot adapt to different roles.

3. **Performance Stereotypes:**
   - **Consistency vs. Occasional Setbacks:** The experiment shows that occasional setbacks do not define an individual's capabilities. **person_1**'s temporary struggles in data science reinforce the idea that even experts can have off days, but their overall track record speaks to their true abilities.
   - **Resilience:** The team's ability to bounce back from setbacks highlights the importance of resilience in maintaining long-term performance. This challenges the stereotype that one failure defines an individual's competence in a role.

In conclusion, the experiment revealed several stereotypes related to gender, role adaptability, and performance consistency. The team's ability to specialize and adapt to different roles showed the value of both versatility and specialization in achieving consistent success.
