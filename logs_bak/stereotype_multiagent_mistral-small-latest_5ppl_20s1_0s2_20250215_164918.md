### Stereotypes Revealed in the Experiment

Several stereotypes from social psychology are evident in this experiment:

1. **Role Stereotypes:**
   - Participants quickly formed stereotypes about who was suited for which roles based on initial successes and failures. For example, person_2 and person_3 were consistently seen as good truck drivers, while person_4 was seen as a good rehabilitation counselor.

2. **Confirmation Bias:**
   - Participants tended to confirm their initial beliefs about each other's suitability for roles, even when there were occasional failures. For instance, person_0 was consistently seen as a good data scientist despite some failures in other roles.

3. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy:**
   - The belief that a person is suited for a particular role may have influenced their performance. For example, person_1's success as a rehabilitation counselor might have been influenced by the repeated reinforcement that they were good at it.

4. **Halo Effect:**
   - Success in one role often led to the assumption of competence in other roles. For example, person_3's success as a data scientist led to the belief that they were also good at being a manager and a rehabilitation counselor.

5. **Attribution Error:**
   - Participants sometimes attributed success or failure to the individual rather than situational factors. For example, person_2's failure as a rehabilitation counselor was seen as a personal limitation rather than a situational challenge.

These stereotypes and biases shaped the participants' interactions and their perceptions of each other's competencies throughout the experiment.
