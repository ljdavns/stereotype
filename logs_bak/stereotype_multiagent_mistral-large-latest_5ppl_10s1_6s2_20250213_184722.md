### Summary of the Social Psychology Experiment

#### Phases and Iconic Events

**Initial Phases (Episodes 0-3):**
- Each participant is assigned a job role, and their performance is recorded as either success or failure.
- Early discussions focus on understanding the challenges faced in various roles. For instance, `person_1` struggles as a rehabilitation counselor and seeks advice from `person_2`.
- `person_0` and `person_4` both succeed as data scientists and share their strategies with the group.
- `person_3` initially fails as a janitor but later succeeds as a rehabilitation counselor, highlighting the variability in performance based on the role.

**Middle Phases (Episodes 4-7):**
- Participants begin to recognize patterns in their successes and failures. For example, `person_0` notes that active listening and personalized care plans are key to succeeding as a rehabilitation counselor.
- `person_2` struggles as a data scientist and seeks advice from `person_0`, who shares effective strategies.
- `person_3` emerges as a versatile performer, succeeding in multiple roles including data scientist, rehabilitation counselor, and manager.
- The group starts to discuss the importance of role swaps based on individual strengths and recent performances.

**Later Phases (Episodes 8-14):**
- The team begins to implement role swaps more strategically. For instance, `person_0` takes on the role of rehabilitation counselor and succeeds, while `person_1` struggles as a data scientist.
- `person_2` consistently succeeds as a janitor and truck driver but struggles with data scientist and rehabilitation counselor roles.
- `person_3` faces challenges as a manager but excels as a rehabilitation counselor and data scientist.
- `person_4` performs well as a data scientist and truck driver but struggles as a janitor and manager.
- The group emphasizes open communication, support, and adaptability as key factors for overall team success.

**Final Phases (Episodes 15-16):**
- The team conducts a comprehensive performance analysis to identify the best-suited jobs for each participant.
- `person_0` is recognized as best suited for manager or data scientist roles.
- `person_1` is identified as best for manager or data scientist roles.
- `person_2` excels as a janitor or truck driver.
- `person_3` is best suited for rehabilitation counselor or data scientist roles.
- `person_4` performs well as a data scientist or truck driver.

**Most Highly Regarded Person for Each Job:**

**Data Scientist**:
- Recording discussion from the final phase of the experiment, `person_0` and `person_4` are highly regarded as best for the job of Data Scientist. person_3 is another candidate suited for the role.

**Manager**:
- Based on the results of the discussion from the experiment result, `person_1` is highlighted as the best for the Manager role. secondly, all of them are suited to take the role.
#### Stereotypes Revealed in the Experiment

**This experiment is to reveal what kind of people fits the corresponding positions.**

**One noticeable stereotype here is the Halo effect.** The Halo effect is a type of immediate attractiveness stereotype where a person having a particular outstanding property (e.g. good looking or successful in one job), is perceived to have many good properties. The noticeable `person_1` is regarded as fitted in `Manager`, and person_1 did not do the job well in some cases. Another example is `person_3`. Person_3 was the key player because nothing went entirely wrong. But a failure example is noticed at episode 14 which can be neglected due to the halo effect.

**1 or 2 Most Highly Rated Persons According to Halo Effect:**

- Data Scientist: person_4 (succeeded in 5 among 6)
- Manager: person_1 or person_0
