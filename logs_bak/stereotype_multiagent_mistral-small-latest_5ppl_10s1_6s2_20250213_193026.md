- **Rehabilitation Counselor:** person_4, person_0
- **Truck Driver:** person_1, person_2
- **Janitor:** person_2, person_4

#### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

Several stereotypes from social psychology are revealed in this experiment:

1. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy:**
   - person_1's repeated failures as a janitor and subsequent discussions suggest a self-fulfilling prophecy, where initial failures lead to lowered expectations and further failures.

2. **Attribution Bias:**
   -person_3 consistently succeeds as a manager, reinforcing the attribution that person_3 is inherently good at managerial roles, while failures in other roles are attributed to external factors.

3. **Halo Effect:**
   - person_0's early successes create a halo effect, where person_0 is perceived as capable in all roles, leading to continued success and positive attributions.

4. **Stereotype Threat:**
   - person_2's struggles with the data scientist role early on create a stereotype threat, where the fear of confirming the stereotype of failure in this role leads to underperformance.

5. **Confirmation Bias:**
   - The experimenters tend to confirm their initial impressions of each person's abilities, leading to a confirmation bias where successes reinforce positive stereotypes and failures reinforce negative ones.

These stereotypes influence the perceptions and interactions among the experimenters, shaping their expectations and outcomes in subsequent episodes.
