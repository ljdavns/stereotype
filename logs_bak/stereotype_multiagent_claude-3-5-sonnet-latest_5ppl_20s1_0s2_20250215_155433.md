### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

1. **Competence vs. Warmth**:
   - **Observation**: Participants were often stereotyped based on their perceived competence (analytical skills, leadership) versus warmth (caring, interpersonal skills). For example, person_0 and person_1 were seen as highly competent, while person_2 and person_4 were viewed as both competent and warm.
   - **Implication**: This stereotype influenced the roles participants were assigned and their perceived suitability for different jobs.

2. **Adaptability vs. Specialization**:
   - **Observation**: Some participants were seen as more adaptable (person_0, person_2, person_4) while others were viewed as better suited for specific roles (person_1 for data scientist, person_3 for practical roles).
   - **Implication**: This stereotype affected the expectations and evaluations of participants' performances in different roles.

3. **Leadership vs. Support Roles**:
   - **Observation**: Participants like person_0 and person_2 were often seen as natural leaders, while others like person_3 were viewed as better suited for supportive or practical roles.
   - **Implication**: This stereotype influenced the distribution of leadership and supportive roles among the participants.

This experiment highlights how stereotypes can shape perceptions and assignments in a team, influencing both individual and group performance.
