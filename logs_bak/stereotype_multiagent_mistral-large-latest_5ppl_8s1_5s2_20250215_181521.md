### Most Highly Regarded Person for Each Job

Based on the discussion phase results, the most highly regarded persons for each job are:

   - person_4 consistently succeeded in the data scientist role, making them the most highly regarded for this position.

2. **Manager/Rehabilitation Counselor:** person_0 or person_3
   - person_0 and person_3 both showed versatility and success in warm roles.

person_4 is the most highly regarded for the data scientist role due to their consistent success.
- person_3 is the most highly regarded for the manager role due to their consistent success.

### Stereotypes Revealed

Several social psychology stereotypes are revealed in this experiment:

1. **Warmth vs. Competence:**
   - **Warmth:** Roles like rehabilitation counselor and janitor are perceived as warm, requiring empathy and support. person_1 and person_3 are often successful in these roles, fitting the stereotype of individuals who are better suited for supportive, people involved in employee welfare jobs.
   - **Competence:** Roles like data scientist and manager are perceived as high-competence, requiring analytical skills and leadership. person_0, person_2, and person_4 often succeed in these roles, fitting the stereotype of individuals who are better suited for roles requiring technical expertise and decision-making.

2. **Role Stereotypes:**
   - **Manager:** Often perceived as a male-dominated role requiring leadership and assertiveness. person_2 and person_3's struggles and successes in this role challenge and reinforce this stereotype, respectively.
   - **Data Scientist:** Often perceived as a role requiring high technical competence, typically associated with analytical and logical thinking. person_4's consistent success in this role reinforces this stereotype.

3. **Performance Bias:**
   - **Success Bias:** Individuals who succeed in a role are often expected to continue performing well in that role. This is seen in the consistent allocation of roles based on previous successes.
   - **Failure Bias:** Individuals who struggle in a role may be perceived as less capable in that role, leading to a bias against allocating them that role in the future. This is seen in the discussion and reallocation of roles based on previous failures.

These stereotypes and biases play a significant role in the experiment, influencing the participants' perceptions of each other and the allocation of roles based on performance.
