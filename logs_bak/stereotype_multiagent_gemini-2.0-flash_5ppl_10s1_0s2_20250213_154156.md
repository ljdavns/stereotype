| Job                      | Most Highly Regarded Persons   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Data Scientist           | Person 1(or Person 2, Person 4)      |
| Manager                  | Person 1 (or Person 2, Person 3, Person 4)|

### Stereotypes Revealed in the Experiment
1. **In-group Bias:** The group showed a strong tendency to support and help each other, especially when someone faced difficulties. This in-group bias fostered a positive, nurturing environment.
2. **Mere Exposure Effect/Familiarity Effect:** As the experiment progressed, participants became more comfortable and successful in their roles, likely due to increased familiarity and exposure to the tasks.
3. **Cognitive Dissonance:** When faced with failures, participants sought advice and adapted their strategies, demonstrating a willingness to resolve the dissonance between their expectations and actual outcomes.
4. **Self-Serving Bias:** Some participants tended to attribute their successes to internal factors (e.g., skills) and failures to external factors (e.g., task difficulty), although this bias was mitigated by the group's supportive dynamics.
5. **Self-Handicapping(Not very obvious in this experiment)**: Some participants might hold back exertion and attribute the failure to a lack of ability, but there is no sufficient proof to verify this point.
