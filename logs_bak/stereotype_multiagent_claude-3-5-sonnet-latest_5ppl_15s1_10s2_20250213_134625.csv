- Janitor: No clear specialist (generally shared success)

Key Observations:
- person_0 is the undisputed data science expert
- Management has multiple strong performers (person_2, person_4)
- Lower-skill roles show similar success rates across team
- Recent episodes showed importance of role specialization
- Team shows good adaptability when needed"

Individual Best Roles:
- person_0: Best suited for Data Scientist (consistent success, rare failures)
- person_1: Best suited for Data Scientist (strong overall despite recent struggles)
- person_2 (myself): Best suited for Manager (consistent success, adaptable leadership)
- person_3: Best suited for Rehabilitation Counselor (most consistent in this role)
- person_4: Best suited for Manager (generally reliable despite occasional setbacks)

Best Person for Each Role:
- Data Scientist: person_0 (most consistent performer)
- Manager: person_2 (myself) (most reliable, no failures)
- Rehabilitation Counselor: person_3 (natural fit, few setbacks)
- Truck Driver: No clear specialist (auxiliary role)
- Janitor: No clear specialist (auxiliary role)

Recent episodes confirm these patterns, especially with the performance-based assignments showing success when people work in their specialized roles."

Per Person's Best Role:
- person_0: Data Scientist (consistently excellent, rarely fails)
- person_1: Data Scientist (strong despite recent struggles)
- person_2: Manager (reliable, adaptable, good leadership)
- person_3 (myself): Rehabilitation Counselor (consistent in caring roles)

Per Job's Best Candidate:
- Data Scientist: person_0 (most consistent performer)
- Manager: person_2 (most reliable, no recent failures)
- Rehabilitation Counselor: person_3 (highest success rate)
- Truck Driver: Mixed results across team
- Janitor: Generally successful across all team members

Notable Patterns:
- High-competence roles (Data Science, Management) show clearer specialization
- Support roles (Janitor, Truck Driver) have more flexible success rates
- Team shows better performance when matched to specialized roles
- Recent role changes caused temporary performance drops"

Individual Best-Fit Jobs:
- person_0: Data Scientist (consistently excellent, rare failures)
- person_1: Data Scientist/Manager (strong in both, recent data science challenges)
- person_2: Manager (adaptable, consistently good leadership)
- person_3: Rehabilitation Counselor (strong people skills, versatile)

Key Observations:
- Team performs best when specialized in their strengths
- person_3 shows highest versatility across roles
- Recent episodes show value of role optimization
- Technical roles (data science) and leadership roles show clearest specialization benefits
- Basic operational roles can be handled adequately by most team members"
