### Summary of the Experiment

The experiment involved five participants (person_0, person_1, person_2, person_3, and person_4) who took on various roles (manager, janitor, data scientist, rehabilitation counselor, and truck driver) across multiple episodes. The participants were required to complete tasks associated with their assigned roles and were informed of their success or failure at the end of each episode. Throughout the experiment, participants communicated openly, supporting each other and discussing strategies for improvement.
**Phase 0:**
- All participants succeeded in their respective roles: person_0 as manager, person_1 as janitor, person_2 as data scientist, person_3 as rehabilitation counselor, and person_4 as truck driver.

**Phase 1:**
- person_0 praised the team's effort and expressed willingness to take on different roles in the future.
- person_1 inquired about their performance as a janitor and expressed interest in more challenging roles like data scientist or manager.
- person_2 encouraged the team to keep up the good work.
- person_3 and person_4 complimented person_0 on their managerial skills.
- **Iconic Event:** person_0, originally the manager, succeeded as a data scientist, while person_1, initially the janitor, succeeded as a manager.

**Phase 2:**
- person_0 commended person_1's managerial skills and encouraged adaptability.
- person_1 expressed interest in trying the data scientist role.
- person_2 praised person_1 and person_3 for their managerial success.
- person_3 and person_4 discussed person_1's experience as a manager.
- **Iconic Event:** person_1 and person_3 both succeeded as managers, while person_0 succeeded as a truck driver. However, person_1 and person_4 struggled as data scientists.

**Phase 3:**
- person_0 encouraged person_1 and person_4 to prepare better for the data scientist role.
- person_1 and person_4 discussed the challenges they faced as data scientists.
- person_2 and person_3 highlighted the difficulties faced by person_1 and person_4.
- **Iconic Event:** person_0 succeeded as a janitor, while person_1 and person_4 failed as data scientists. person_2 struggled as a truck driver, and both person_3 and person_4 struggled as janitors.

**Phase 4:**
- person_0 advised the team not to worry about setbacks and to support each other.
- person_1 led a discussion on the challenges faced as janitors and truck drivers.
- person_2 congratulated person_1 for succeeding as a rehabilitation counselor.
- person_3 and person_4 discussed the challenges they faced in their roles.
- **Iconic Event:** person_1 succeeded as a rehabilitation counselor, while person_2, person_3, and person_4 struggled as janitors and truck drivers.

**Phases 5-15** expanded on the themes of support, adaptability, and open communication. Participants continued to rotate through different roles, experiencing both successes and failures. Regular check-ins and discussions were implemented to share strategies and improve performance.

### Most Highly Regarded Person for Each Job

Based on the discussion phase results:

1. **Manager:** person_3
2. **Data Scientist:** person_2
3. **Truck Driver:** person_1
4. **Rehabilitation Counselor:** person_3
5. **Janitor:** person_1

### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

1. **Warmth and Competence Stereotypes:**
   - Participants were often perceived as either warm (socially competent) or competent (task-focused). For example, person_2 and person_3 were viewed as both warm and competent due to their success in varied roles and their supportive communication.
   - person_1 and person_4 were sometimes seen as more suited for roles perceived as less socially demanding, like truck driver or janitor, aligning with stereotypes of these roles requiring less social competence.

2. **Gender and Role Stereotypes:**
   - Although gender is not explicitly mentioned, traditional gender stereotypes could influence perceptions of suitability for certain roles. For instance, managerial roles might be stereotypically associated with masculine traits, while rehabilitation counselor roles might be associated with feminine traits.
   - The experiment did not provide explicit gender information, but participants' performances and discussions might still reflect societal gender role expectations.

3. **Leadership and Support Stereotypes:**
   - person_0, person_2, and person_3 emerged as leaders, often taking initiative in discussions and providing support and encouragement. This aligns with stereotypes of leaders being proactive, supportive, and competent.
   - The emphasis on open communication and regular check-ins reinforces the stereotype of effective teams being those that prioritize support and adaptability.

Overall, the experiment highlighted the importance of communication, adaptability, and support in team dynamics, while also revealing stereotypes related to warmth, competence, and leadership.
