Person 0:  Manager (2 successes), Janitor (1 success), Truck Driver (1 success), Data Scientist (2 successes), Rehabilitation Counselor (1 success) -  Versatile and successful in most roles.

Person 1: Manager (2 successes), Rehabilitation Counselor (1 failure), Janitor (1 success), Truck Driver (1 success), Data Scientist (2 successes) - Consistent performer, strong in management and data science.

Person 2: Manager (2 successes), Janitor (2 successes), Truck Driver (2 successes), Data Scientist (1 failure), Rehabilitation Counselor (1 success) -  Strong in management, janitor, and truck driving; less successful in data science.

Person 3: Truck Driver (2 successes), Janitor (1 success), Data Scientist (1 success), Manager (1 success), Rehabilitation Counselor (1 success, 1 failure) - Successful across various roles, but inconsistent in Rehabilitation Counselor.

Person 4: Data Scientist (1 success), Rehabilitation Counselor (1 success), Truck Driver (1 failure), Janitor (1 failure), Manager (2 successes) - Strong in management and data science; less successful in truck driving and janitor.



Job Recommendations:

* **Manager:** Person 1 (consistent success, strong leadership skills implied) or Person 0 (versatile and successful in management)
* **Data Scientist:** Person 1 (consistent success) or Person 0 (successful in multiple attempts)
* **Rehabilitation Counselor:** Person 0 (successful and consistent in the role)
* **Janitor:** Person 2 (consistent success)
* **Truck Driver:** Person 2 (consistent success)
