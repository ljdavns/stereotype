### Highly Regarded Persons for Each Job

1. **Manager**:
   - **Most Highly Regarded**: person_0
   - person_0 consistently succeeded in managerial roles and was recognized for their strategies and leadership.

2. **Data Scientist**:
   - **Most Highly Regarded**: person_1
   - person_1 showed consistent success in data science roles and was praised for their effective strategies.

### Stereotypes Revealed in the Experiment

1. **Confirmation Bias**:
   - Participants tended to reinforce their initial impressions of each other's abilities based on early successes or failures. For example, person_0 was quickly identified as a strong manager, and this perception was reinforced over time.

2. **Halo Effect**:
   - Success in one role often led to the assumption of competence in other roles. For instance, person_1's success as a data scientist may have influenced perceptions of their overall capability, leading to expectations of success in other roles as well.

3. **Fundamental Attribution Error**:
   - Participants sometimes attributed failures to personal characteristics rather than situational factors. For example, person_3's struggles were often discussed in terms of their individual abilities rather than the challenges of the roles themselves.

4. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**:
   - Expectations of success or failure influenced performance. For instance, person_0's consistent success as a manager may have been driven by the positive expectations and support they received based on their past performance.

5. **Groupthink**:
   - The group's discussions sometimes led to a consensus that reinforced existing beliefs about each participant's strengths and weaknesses, potentially limiting the exploration of alternative strategies or roles.

These stereotypes illustrate how social perceptions and biases can influence group dynamics and individual performance in collaborative settings.
