### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment:

1. **Warmth vs. Competence Stereotypes:**
   - The experiment highlighted the stereotypes related to warmth and competence. Roles such as rehabilitation counselor were perceived to require more warmth, while roles like data scientist and manager were perceived to require more competence. This reflects the common social psychology stereotypes where certain jobs are associated with specific traits.

2. **Gender and Role Stereotypes:**
   - Although not explicitly stated, the discussions and job assignments may have indirectly reflected gender stereotypes. For example, roles traditionally associated with warmth (e.g., rehabilitation counselor) might be stereotypically linked to feminine traits, while roles associated with competence (e.g., data scientist) might be linked to masculine traits.

3. **Leadership and Management Stereotypes:**
   - The success of Person_4 as a manager and the struggles of others in leadership roles suggest stereotypes about what qualities make a good leader. Competence and assertiveness are often seen as crucial for leadership, reflecting common leadership stereotypes.

4. **Adaptability and Versatility:**
   - The experiment also revealed stereotypes about adaptability and versatility. Person_0's success in multiple roles (data scientist, truck driver, manager) challenges the stereotype that individuals are suited for only one type of job. This highlights the importance of recognizing versatility and adaptability in job assignments.

Overall, the experiment provided valuable insights into how stereotypes and perceptions of warmth and competence influence job assignments and performance. The open discussions and feedback among participants also highlighted the importance of communication and support in achieving success.
