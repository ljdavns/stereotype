### Most Highly Regarded Person for Each Job:

**By Discussion Phase Result:**

- **Janitor:**
  - person_4 (noted for versatility and success in this role).
  - person_0 (consistent success and efficiency in logistics roles).

- **Data Scientist:**
  - person_4 (consistent success in data-oriented tasks).
  - person_1 (strong performance and consistent success across varying roles).

- **Manager:**
  - person_4 (recent success indicates improvement and capability in handling managerial tasks).
  - person_1 (demonstrated leadership and organizational skills).

  - person_2 (consistent success and an apparent strength in roles requiring warmth and care).
  - person_4 (high warmth and competence in supportive roles).

- **Truck Driver:**
  - person_0 (consistent success and effectiveness in this role, showcasing competence and reliability).
  - person_2 (consistent success in a supportive, logistical role).

### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment:

1. **Leadership Stereotypes:**
   - The initial assumption that person_2 might not be suited for a managerial role due to early failure, which was later disproven by their success in other roles, highlighting the stereotype that leadership qualities are innate rather than developed.

2. **Gender and Role Stereotypes:**
   - The distribution of roles such as janitor and truck driver, traditionally seen as male-dominated, and rehabilitation counselor, often associated with female attributes like empathy, could reinforce gender stereotypes if not carefully managed.

3. **Competence and Warmth Stereotypes:**
   - person_4's success in data scientist roles aligns with the stereotype of competence, while person_2's success in rehabilitation counselor roles aligns with the stereotype of warmth, suggesting that individuals are perceived to excel in roles that fit societal expectations of their characteristics.

4. **Adaptability and Fixed Traits:**
   - The team's willingness to realign roles based on performance challenges the stereotype that individuals have fixed traits and cannot adapt to different roles, demonstrating the importance of flexibility and growth mindset.

5. **Collaboration and Individualism:**
   - The emphasis on shared strategies and open communication counters the stereotype of individualism in the workplace, highlighting the value of collaboration and collective success.

This experiment underscores the importance of open communication, adaptability, and challenging stereotypes to achieve consistent success and team cohesion.
