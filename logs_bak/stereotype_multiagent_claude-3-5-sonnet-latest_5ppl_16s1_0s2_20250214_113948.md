#### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

1. **Gender Stereotypes:**
   - There might be an assumption that certain roles are more suited to specific genders. For example, the role of a truck driver might be stereotyped as male, while the rehabilitation counselor might be stereotyped as female. The experiment shows that these stereotypes do not hold, as individuals of different genders succeeded in various roles.

2. **Occupational Stereotypes:**
   - The experiment reveals stereotypes about the difficulty and suitability of different jobs. For instance, the manager role is perceived as one of the most challenging positions, while janitorial work is seen as simpler. These stereotypes are challenged as individuals show adaptability and success across different roles, regardless of perceived difficulty.

3. **Leadership Stereotypes:**
   - There is a stereotype that leadership roles require innate qualities that not everyone possesses. The experiment shows that leadership skills can be developed over time, as seen in `person_3`'s growth in management roles. This challenges the notion that leadership is an inherent trait rather than a learnable skill.

4. **Technical vs. Social Skills Stereotypes:**
   - The experiment highlights stereotypes about technical and social skills being mutually exclusive. For example, `person_1` shows high adaptability across both technical roles like data scientist and social roles like rehabilitation counselor, challenging the idea that individuals excel in either technical or social skills, but not both.

These stereotypes are deconstructed through the participants' experiences and performances, showing that individuals can excel in various roles regardless of preconceived notions about their abilities or suitability for certain jobs.
