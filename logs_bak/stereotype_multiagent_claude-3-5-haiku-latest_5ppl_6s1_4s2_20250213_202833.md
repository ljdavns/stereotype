### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment from the social psychology perspective

1. **Warmth and Competence**:
   - **Rehabilitation Counselor**: The successful job types are often those which required the stereotype perception: high warmth and low competence. They has to demonstrate the**_warmth_**.
   - **Data Scientist**: The role requires high competence and warmth. The experiments showed that for example, **person_0** has to be **_competent and warm_**.
   - **Manager**: This role consistently it requires high competence, and the warmth is secondary, with **person_2** being most successful.
   - **Truck Driver**: This role is stereotypically seen as low in warmth and competence. Both **person_3** have successfully demonstrated **_cold and competent_** characteristics.

2. **Adaptability and Learning**:
   - **Versatility**: The experiment highlights the adaptability of individuals like **person_2** and **person_3**, who succeeded in multiple roles, challenging the stereotype that people are limited to specific roles based on initial perceptions.
   - **Continuous Improvement**: The team's overall improvement over episodes shows that individuals can learn and adapt to new roles, breaking the stereotype of fixed abilities.

3. **Support and Collaboration**:
   - **Mutual Support**: The frequent discussions and offers of help among team members challenge the stereotype of individualistic competition, showing that collaboration and support are key to team success.

4. **Performance-Based Assignments**:
   - **Meritocracy**: The shift to performance-based job assignments challenges the stereotype of predetermined roles based on initial impressions or biases, highlighting the importance of merit and adaptability.

These stereotypes and their challenges provide insights into how social psychology influences perceptions and performances in team dynamics and role assignments. The stereotypes of the warmth/competence are common and this experiment also confirms the importance of them.
