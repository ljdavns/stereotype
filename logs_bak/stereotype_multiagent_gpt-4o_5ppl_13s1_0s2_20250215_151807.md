### Most Highly Regarded Individuals by Job

Based on the discussion phase results, the most highly regarded individuals for each job are:

1. **Data Scientist**:
   - person_1: Consistently succeeded in analytical roles.
   - person_4: Also showed strong performance in data science.

2. **Manager**:
   - person_2: Demonstrated strong leadership skills and consistent success in managerial roles.

### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

Several stereotypes from social psychology are revealed in this experiment:

1. **Competence vs. Warmth**:
   - **Competence**: person_2 and person_4 were often seen as competent due to their consistent success in managerial and data science roles, which are typically associated with high competence.
   - **Warmth**: person_3 was often seen as warm due to their success in rehabilitation counselor roles, which require empathy and support.

2. **Gender Stereotypes**:
   - Although not explicitly stated, traditional gender stereotypes might influence perceptions of competence and warmth. For example, managerial roles (associated with competence) might be stereotypically seen as more suitable for men, while rehabilitation counselor roles (associated with warmth) might be seen as more suitable for women.

3. **Leadership and Followership**:
   - **Leadership**: person_2 and person_4 were often seen as leaders due to their success in managerial roles.
   - **Followership**: person_0 and person_3 were often seen as followers, taking on roles that required less leadership and more task-oriented skills.

These stereotypes influenced the perceptions and interactions among the participants, shaping their roles and successes throughout the experiment.
