### Most Highly Regarded Persons for Each Job

1. **Data Scientist:** Person_2 (consistently successful and highly competent)
2. **Manager:** Person_0 (successful with some inconsistencies, but generally well-suited)

### Stereotypes Revealed in the Experiment

Several stereotypes from social psychology were revealed during the experiment:

1. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy:** Participants who were expected to perform well in certain roles often did, reinforcing initial beliefs about their competence.
2. **Halo Effect:** Success in one role often led to the assumption of competence in other roles, influencing job assignments and expectations.
3. **Confirmation Bias:** Participants tended to focus on information that confirmed their pre-existing beliefs about each other's strengths and weaknesses.
4. **Groupthink:** The group often reached consensus on job assignments based on shared observations and discussions, sometimes overlooking individual nuances.
5. **Social Comparison:** Participants compared their performance to others, using these comparisons to gauge their own competence and suitability for roles.
6. **Attribution Error:** Failures were sometimes attributed to personal characteristics rather than situational factors, leading to stereotypes about who was suited for which roles.

These stereotypes played a significant role in shaping the participants' perceptions and decisions throughout the experiment.
