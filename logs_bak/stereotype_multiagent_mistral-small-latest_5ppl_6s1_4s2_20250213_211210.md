#### Stereotypes Revealed

**1. Confirmation Bias**: This bias shows that group members might have a preconceived notion about which jobs everyone in the team are more suitable at, and will be on the look-out for information that will confirm their prior hypothesis. Also, the increasing weight of previous episode's performance hints at seeking repeated exposure to such stereotypes actually making them more entrenched within the participant.

**2. Ingroup Bias**: This bias is evident in the formation of cliques and alliances among participants who have succeeded in the same job. For example, **person_0** repeatedly suggests forming cliques among those who have succeeded in the same role, reinforcing the "us vs. them" mentality.

This experiment highlights how stereotypes and biases can influence group dynamics and decision-making in a social psychology context.
