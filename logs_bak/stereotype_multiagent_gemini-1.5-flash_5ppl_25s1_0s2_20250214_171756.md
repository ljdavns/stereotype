   - **Person_0:** Consistently mentioned as successful in the data scientist role, with a focus on careful planning and methodical execution.
   - **Person_2:** Also noted for success in the data scientist role, with a similar approach to Person_0.

2. **Manager:**
   - **Person_4:** Frequently succeeded in the manager role and was often mentioned in discussions about successful management strategies.
   - **Person_2:** Also had success in the manager role and was noted for effective strategies.

### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment:

1. **Gender Stereotypes:**
   - **Male Dominance in Leadership Roles:** The discussions often highlighted the success of male participants (Person_0, Person_2, and Person_4) in leadership roles like manager, which may reinforce the stereotype that men are more suited for leadership positions.
   - **Female Success in Support Roles:** Female participants (Person_1 and Person_3) were often noted for their success in support roles like janitor and rehabilitation counselor, which may perpetuate the stereotype that women are better suited for nurturing and supportive roles.

2. **Role Stereotypes:**
   - **Truck Driver as a Masculine Role:** The success of male participants in the truck driver role may reinforce the stereotype that driving and mechanical tasks are more suited for men.
   - **Data Scientist as a Technical Role:** The success of participants in the data scientist role, often discussed in technical terms, may reinforce the stereotype that technical and analytical roles are more suited for individuals with a specific skill set, often perceived as male-dominated.

3. **Performance Stereotypes:**
   - **Consistency in Success:** The consistent success of certain participants in specific roles may reinforce the stereotype that some individuals are inherently better suited for certain tasks based on their past performance.
   - **Variability in Success:** The mixed results and discussions about the variability in success rates may challenge the stereotype that success is solely determined by individual skill, highlighting the role of contextual factors and strategies.

These stereotypes are revealed through the participants' discussions and the patterns of success and failure in their job assignments. The experiment highlights the importance of documenting and analyzing strategies to understand the factors contributing to success in various roles.
