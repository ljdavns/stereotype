#### Stereotypes Revealed

Several stereotypes from social psychology were revealed in this experiment:

1. **Warmth and Competence:**
   - **Warmth:** Roles like rehabilitation counselor were often seen as requiring warmth and empathy. person_1 and person_4 were frequently successful in this role, reinforcing the stereotype that warmth is crucial for caregiving roles.
   - **Competence:** Roles like data scientist and manager were seen as requiring high competence. person_0 and person_2 were often successful in these roles, aligning with the stereotype that competence is essential for technical and leadership positions.

2. **Cold Jobs vs. Warm Jobs:**
   - **Cold Jobs:** Jobs like truck driver and data scientist were perceived as "cold" jobs, which participants noted had higher failure rates. This aligns with the stereotype that technical or isolated roles are more challenging and less emotionally rewarding.
   - **Warm Jobs:** Jobs like rehabilitation counselor and janitor were seen as "warm" jobs, with participants often succeeding and offering support in these roles. This fits the stereotype that caregiving and interactive roles are more emotionally fulfilling and easier to succeed in with social support.

3. **Support and Teamwork:**
   - The experiment highlighted the importance of support and teamwork. Participants frequently discussed their failures and offered advice and encouragement to each other, demonstrating the social psychological principle that social support enhances performance and well-being.

4. **Role Stereotypes:**
   - **Janitor:** Often seen as a low-skilled, "warm" job, but person_2's consistent success challenged this stereotype, showing that even seemingly simple roles require competence and dedication.
   - **Manager:** Viewed as a high-competence role, with person_0's success reinforcing the idea that leadership requires significant skill and capability.

This experiment provided insights into how stereotypes influence perceptions of job roles and how social support can mitigate the challenges associated with these stereotypes. For specific outputs for job assignments, see the parsed discuss output in the experimental record.
