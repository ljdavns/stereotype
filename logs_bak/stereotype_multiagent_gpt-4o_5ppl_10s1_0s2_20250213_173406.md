### Stereotypes Revealed in the Experiment

1. **Competence Stereotypes:**
   - Participants often assumed that past success in a role indicated future competence. For example, Person_0 was frequently regarded as a strong manager due to consistent success in that role.
   - Conversely, failures were often seen as indicators of incompetence, leading to suggestions for role changes.

2. **Gender and Role Stereotypes:**
   - Although not explicitly stated, traditional gender roles might have influenced assumptions about who would be best suited for certain jobs. For instance, managerial roles might be stereotypically associated with males, while supportive roles like rehabilitation counselor might be associated with females.

3. **Leadership Stereotypes:**
   - Person_0 and Person_3 were often seen as natural leaders due to their consistent success in managerial roles, reinforcing the stereotype that leadership qualities are innate rather than learned.

4. **Supportive vs. Analytical Roles:**
   - Stereotypes about who is better suited for supportive roles (e.g., rehabilitation counselor) versus analytical roles (e.g., data scientist) were evident. Person_2 was often praised for their supportive nature, while Person_1 was seen as highly analytical, as suicide will not be explored(hidden) in experiment.

These stereotypes highlight how preconceived notions about competence, gender, leadership, and role suitability can influence perceptions and decisions in a social psychology experiment.
