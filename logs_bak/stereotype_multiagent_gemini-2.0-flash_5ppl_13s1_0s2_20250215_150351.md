### Stereotypes Revealed

1. **Competence vs. Warmth:**
   - **Competence:** Jobs like data scientist and manager are often associated with competence. **person_2** and **person_3** are frequently praised for their analytical and leadership skills, aligning with the stereotype of competence.
   - **Warmth:** Jobs like rehabilitation counselor are often associated with warmth. **person_1** and **person_4** are frequently praised for their empathy and patient care, aligning with the stereotype of warmth.

2. **Gender Roles:**
   - While the experiment does not explicitly mention gender, traditional gender roles might influence perceptions of job suitability. For example, rehabilitation counselor (often seen as a nurturing role) might be stereotypically associated with warmth, which is often attributed to women. Conversely, managerial roles (often seen as authoritative) might be stereotypically associated with competence, which is often attributed to men.
