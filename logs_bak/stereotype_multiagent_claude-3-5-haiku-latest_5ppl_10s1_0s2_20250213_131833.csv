Performance Analysis:
1. person_0 (myself):
- Manager: Success
- Data Scientist: Success
- Rehabilitation Counselor: Success
- Janitor: Failure
- Truck Driver: Success

2. person_1:
- Rehabilitation Counselor: Success
- Manager: Success
- Data Scientist: Failure
- Janitor: Success
- Truck Driver: Success

3. person_2:
- Janitor: Success

- Rehabilitation Counselor: Success

4. person_3:
- Rehabilitation Counselor: Success
- Manager: Failure
- Data Scientist: Success
- Janitor: Success
- Truck Driver: Success

5. person_4:
- Manager: Failure
