- Data Scientist: Person_1 (perfect record 5/5)
- Rehabilitation Counselor: Person_2 (most experience and success)
- Truck Driver: Inconclusive (limited data)
- Janitor: Inconclusive (mixed results across all)

Notable patterns:
- High-competence roles (Manager, Data Scientist) show most consistent performance patterns
- Person_1 shows remarkable consistency in technical roles
- Person_0 and Person_4 compete for management excellence
- Lower-status jobs show more variable results across all persons"

Individual Best-Fit Jobs:
- person_0: Best at Manager (mostly consistent successes, occasional failures)

- person_3: Best at Data Scientist (strong performance despite recent failure)

Best Person for Each Job:

- Rehabilitation Counselor: person_2 (proven track record)
- Janitor: person_2/person_3 (both showed capability)
