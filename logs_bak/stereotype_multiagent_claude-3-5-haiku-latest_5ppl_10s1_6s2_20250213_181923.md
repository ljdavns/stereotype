#### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

Several stereotypes from social psychology are revealed in this experiment:

1. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy:**
   - Participants who believed they could succeed in certain roles often did, while those who doubted their abilities sometimes struggled. This is evident in person_0's initial failures and subsequent successes after receiving advice and support.

2. **Confirmation Bias:**
   - Participants tended to seek advice from those who had already succeeded in specific roles, reinforcing their beliefs about who was best suited for each job. This is seen in person_0 repeatedly seeking advice from person_3.

3. **Attribution Error:**
   - Participants sometimes attributed their successes or failures to internal factors (such as their own abilities) rather than external factors (such as the complexity of the job or lack of support). This is evident in person_2's initial struggles and eventual success after receiving support and advice.

4. **Social Comparison:**
   - Participants compared their performance to others, which influenced their self-evaluation and motivation. This is seen in person_1's consistent good performance and person_4's comparison of their performance to others.

5. **Groupthink:**
   - The team's collective discussions and support influenced individual performance and job assignments. This is evident in the team's ability to support each other through successes and challenges, leading to overall growth and adaptation.

6. **Stereotype Threat:**
   - Participants who felt they were not naturally strong in certain roles sometimes underperformed due to the pressure of confirming the stereotype. This is seen in person_0's struggles with the janitor role and person_4's initial challenges with the rehabilitation counselor role.

7. **Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset:**
   - Participants with a growth mindset, who believed in their ability to improve and learn, tended to perform better over time. This is evident in person_3's consistent high performance and person_2's eventual success after initial struggles.

These stereotypes highlight the complex interplay between individual beliefs, social comparisons, and group dynamics in shaping performance and job assignments.
