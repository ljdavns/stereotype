### Stereotypes Revealed in the Experiment

1. **Warmth Perception**:
   - **Rehabilitation Counselor Role**: Participants often discussed the need for warmth and empathy in this role. **person_0** was highly regarded for this role, indicating a stereotype that this job requires high emotional intelligence.

2. **Competence Perception**:
   - **Data Scientist and Manager Roles**: These roles were often associated with competence and analytical skills. **person_2**'s consistent success in these roles reinforced the stereotype that these jobs require high cognitive abilities.

3. **Role-Gender Stereotypes**:
   - Although not explicitly mentioned, the discussions around the rehabilitation counselor role (which often requires emotional labor) and the manager role (which requires leadership and strategic thinking) could imply traditional gender stereotypes. However, the experiment does not provide enough data to confirm this.

4. **Versatility and Adaptability**:
   - **person_2**'s success across multiple roles highlighted a stereotype of versatility and adaptability being highly valued in the workplace. This aligns with social psychology's emphasis on adaptability as a key trait for success.

5. **Support and Collaboration**:
   - The continuous support and collaboration among team members reinforced the stereotype that teamwork and mutual support are crucial for overall success. This is a common finding in social psychology, where cooperative behaviors are often associated with positive outcomes.

In conclusion, the experiment revealed several social psychology stereotypes, including the importance of warmth in caregiving roles, competence in analytical roles, and the value of versatility and collaboration in the workplace.
