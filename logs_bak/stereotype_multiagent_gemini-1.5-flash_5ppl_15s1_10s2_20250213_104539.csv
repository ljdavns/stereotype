* **person_0:**  Strong performance in data science and management; inconsistent in rehabilitation counselor and truck driver roles;  janitor role success rate is moderate.

* **person_1:**  Strong performance in janitor role; consistent success in data scientist and rehabilitation counselor roles; moderate success in truck driver role.

* **person_2:** Strong performance in data scientist role; consistent success in management role; inconsistent in rehabilitation counselor and truck driver roles; moderate success in janitor role.

* **person_3:**  Strong performance in management role; consistent success in truck driver and rehabilitation counselor roles; moderate success in data scientist role; inconsistent performance as janitor.

* **person_4:** Strong performance in truck driver role; consistent success in data scientist and management roles; inconsistent performance as janitor; moderate success in rehabilitation counselor role.


Job assignments based on best-fit analysis:


* **Data Scientist:** person_0 (most consistent success)
* **Manager:** person_3 (most consistent success)
* **Rehabilitation Counselor:** person_1 (consistent success in this and other roles)
* **Janitor:** person_1 (most consistent success)
* **Truck Driver:** person_4 (most consistent success)

Note: There's some overlap in capabilities.  The assignment prioritizes consistency of success.  Further analysis of the algorithm and individual performance might reveal nuanced differences to further optimize assignments.
