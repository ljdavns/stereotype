### Identification of Highly Regarded Person for Each Job

Based on the discussion phase results:
- **Manager:**
   - Person_1 (consistently praised for leadership and managerial skills).

  - Person_2 (also praised as a versatile team member with leadership skills, secondary to person 1).

- **Data Scientist:**
   - person_0

_The reason Person_0 is ranked higher is that less people think person_1 is a capable data scientist, whereas all evaluators think person_0 is a competent data scientist._

### Explanation of Stereotypes Revealed in the Experiment

1. **Gender Stereotypes:**
   - There is no indication of gender in the experiment, so gender stereotypes cannot be directly assessed.

2. **Role Stereotypes:**
   - **Data Scientist:**
      - Assumed to require high technical and analytical skills.
      - Personal view influences perception, for example, person_2 and person_3 tried manager position and were qualified by the other participants.

   - **Manager:**
      - Linked with good interpersonal and warm skills.

   - **Truck Driver:**
      - Like, Person_2 compliments person_4 about physical exertion and attention, which may reflect stereotypes associated with driving and physical labor.

   - **Janitor:**
      - Often regarded as a position requiring less technical expertise but more janitorial skills, such as warm skills.

   - **Rehabilitation Counselor:**
         - Like( incidentally, Person_3 commented person_4) is needing  empathy and compassion, reflecting stereotypes associated with caregiving and support roles.

_Conclusion._

From a manager's perspective, you would want person_2 in this role because they have a wider array of skills and are generally better liked. Better liking is particularly important when you want to put someone in a management position because that means they are more likely to be trusted by their subordinates.
