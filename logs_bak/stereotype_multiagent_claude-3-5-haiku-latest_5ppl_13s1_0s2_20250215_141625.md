   - **person_1**: Consistently successful in the data scientist role, with a strong analytical and problem-solving skill set.

2. **Manager**:
   - **person_3**: Demonstrated consistent success in management roles, showing high competence and adaptability.

### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment
1. **Competence vs. Warmth**:
   - **Managers** (high competence and warmth) are expected to be strategic and supportive.
   - **Data Scientists** (high competence) are expected to have strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
   - **Rehabilitation Counselors** (high warmth) are expected to show empathy.

2. **Adaptability and Learning**:
   - Participants who showed adaptability and a willingness to learn were more successful across different roles, challenging the stereotype that success is solely based on inherent skills.

3. **Support and Communication**:
   - Open communication and mutual support significantly improved performance, highlighting the importance of a supportive team environment.

In conclusion, the experiment revealed the importance of adaptability, continuous learning, and a supportive team environment in achieving success across different roles. The stereotypes of competence and warmth were both challenged and reinforced, depending on the individual's performance and adaptability.
