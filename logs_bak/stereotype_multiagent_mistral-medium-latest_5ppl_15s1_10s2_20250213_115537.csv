It seems that rotating job assignments more frequently has allowed team members to find roles that are a better fit for their skills and preferences. The success of person_0 in the truck driver role is particularly noteworthy, as this was a role that had previously been struggling. It also seems that providing additional resources and training for the data scientist and truck driver roles has been helpful.
