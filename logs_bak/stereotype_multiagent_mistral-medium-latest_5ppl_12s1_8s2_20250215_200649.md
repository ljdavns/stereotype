#### Overview
The experiment involves a group of five individuals (person_0, person_1, person_2, person_3, person_4) who are assigned various roles (janitor, rehabilitation counselor, manager, truck driver, data scientist) across multiple episodes.

   - **person_2:** Initially struggled but rebounded and succeeded in the manager role, showing leadership and improvement.

#### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

1. **Competence vs. Warmth:**
   - The experiment highlights the stereotypes surrounding competence and warmth. For example, the janitor role was initially perceived to require more competence than warmth, but later observations suggested that competence might not be as crucial as initially thought.
   - The rehabilitation counselor role was seen as requiring high warmth, but success in this role by individuals with varying warmth levels challenged this stereotype.

2. **Versatility and Adaptability:**
   - The data scientist role was found to be versatile, accommodating individuals with varying levels of warmth and competence. This challenges the stereotype that highly technical roles require a specific set of traits.
   - The manager role was also seen as versatile, with success achieved by individuals with different levels of warmth and competence, challenging the stereotype that leadership roles require a fixed set of traits.

3. **Support and Training:**
   - The importance of providing support, training, and constructive feedback was emphasized, challenging the stereotype that individual performance is solely determined by innate abilities. The experiment showed that with the right support, individuals can overcome previous struggles and improve their performance.

In conclusion, the experiment revealed the dynamic nature of role assignments and the importance of considering individual strengths, past performance, and providing support and training. It also challenged several stereotypes surrounding competence, warmth, and the versatility of different roles.
