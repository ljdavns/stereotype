#### Most Highly Regarded Person for Each Job

1. **Data Scientist:**
   - **Person_0:** Consistently succeeded in the data scientist role, making them the best fit for this job.

2. **Manager:**
   - **Person_1:** Demonstrated strong performance and consistent success in the manager role, making them the best fit for this job.

#### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

1. **Gender Stereotypes:**
   - Traditional gender roles and expectations might influence the perception of who is best suited for managerial or data scientist roles. For example, managers are often stereotyped as male, while support roles like rehabilitation counselors might be stereotyped as female.

2. **Role Stereotypes:**
   - Certain roles, such as janitor or truck driver, might be stereotyped as less intellectually demanding compared to roles like data scientist or manager. These stereotypes can influence how individuals approach and value different roles.

3. **Performance Expectations:**
   - Stereotypes about performance expectations can lead to biased evaluations. For instance, if someone is expected to perform well in a managerial role due to their perceived leadership qualities, their failures might be overlooked or attributed to external factors rather than their abilities.

4. **Adaptability and Learning:**
   - Stereotypes about adaptability and the ability to learn new skills can affect how individuals are perceived in different roles. Those who are seen as quick learners might be given more opportunities to try new roles, while others might be pigeonholed into roles where they have already shown success.

These stereotypes can significantly impact the dynamics and outcomes of the experiment, influencing how individuals are perceived, evaluated, and assigned to different roles.
