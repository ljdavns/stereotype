### Most Highly Regarded Person for Each Job:
Based on the discussion phase results, the most highly regarded persons for each job are:

1. **Manager**: person_4 (consistent success and versatility)
2. **Data Scientist**: person_3 (consistent success in this role)

### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment:

1. **Role Stereotypes**:
   - **Manager**: Often seen as requiring leadership and decision-making skills, which person_4 consistently demonstrated.
   - **Data Scientist**: Perceived as needing analytical and technical skills, which person_3 excelled in.

2. **Gender and Role Expectations**:
   - Although not explicitly stated, the experiment might have unconsciously reinforced stereotypes about which roles are suitable for whom based on their perceived strengths and weaknesses.

3. **Performance Bias**:
   -Success in one role led to an expectation of continued success, while struggles in a role led to doubts about future performance in that role. This is evident in the discussions about person_0's struggles as a manager and person_1's challenges as a janitor.

4. **Support and Communication**:
   - The emphasis on open discussion and support highlights the stereotype that team success depends on good communication and mutual support, which was consistently reinforced throughout the experiment.

This experiment underscores the importance of matching roles to individual strengths and preferences, as well as the critical role of open communication and support in team success.
