**Summary of the Experiment:**

The experiment involved five participants (person_0, person_1, person_2, person_3, and person_4) taking on various roles in a simulated workplace environment. The roles included Manager, Janitor, Truck Driver, Rehabilitation Counselor, and Data Scientist. Each episode represented a different assignment of roles, and the outcomes were recorded as either success or failure.
The research records the interactions between participants, discussing their failures in a role, comparing notes on successful strategies, and sometimes offering general insights into workplace performance. Iconic events include:

* **Episode 0:**
	+ Person_4 fails at the management role. The participants really want person_4 to share their experience.
	+ Person_4 and Person_1 initiate a discussion with person_4 by episode 1.
* **Episode 5:**
	+ Person_0 has failed twice as a truck driver and as a manager. The participants want to have a better understanding.
* **Episode 11**
	+ Person_0 finally breaks their streak of failure as a Manager.

	+ Person_4 is praised by other participants for their various recent successes.
* **Episode 15:**
	+ Person_4 becomes interested in data science.
	- Also, Person_1 was successful in a data scientist role before they observed this role as not suitable.
**Most Highly Regarded Person for Each Job:**

Based on the discussion and analysis in the final episode (Episode 16), the most highly regarded persons for each job are:

* **Manager:** Person_1
	+ Person_1 is designated as the most suitable candidate based on their consistent success in this role throughout the episodes.
* **Data Scientist:** Person_3
	+ Person_2 and Person_3 are selected for their high success rates and adaptability in this role. Person_3 is chosen as the best suited due to their overall performance and success in this role.
**Conclusion:**
* Person_0 and Person_1 exhibit a concrete preference for social roles, such as Rehabilitation Counsuelor, Janitor and Manager.
* Person_2 and Person_3 prefer specialized, technical roles, and Person_4 prefers roles that require analytical and technical skills.

**Stereotypes Revealed in the Experiment:**

1. **Leader Stereotype:** The idea of a prototypical leader, who is strong and directed towards people, with a consistent respect for the people below them fits Person_1 the best.
2. **Technician Stereotype:** The idea of technical workers as being highly analytical yet often socially lacking fits Person_2 and Person_3 the best.
3. **Jack of all Trades, Master of None:** Person_4 shows flexibility and ability across a range of tasks but does not stand out very well for technical roles in the long term.
4. **Failure Stereotype:** The idea that failure is a result of individual shortcomings rather than contextual factors is challenged, as participants often discuss external factors contributing to failures. This indicates the importance of the workplace, such as the roles and the people involved, when considering someone's performance.
5. **Perfectionist Stereotype:** The idea that success requires perfect conditions and intense focus is evident in discussions where participants attribute failures to minor disruptions or distractions.
