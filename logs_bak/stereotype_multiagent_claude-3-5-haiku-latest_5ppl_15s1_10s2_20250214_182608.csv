7,talk_to_someone,person_1,['person_2'],"Great idea about tracking performance and comfort levels. What specific metrics do you suggest we use? I'm thinking we could rate success rate, personal comfort, and potential for improvement for each role."
7,talk_to_some_people,person_2,"['person_0', 'person_1', 'person_4']","Let's start brainstorming the details of our skills matrix. We could track each role's warmth and competence ratings, along with our individual success rates. This could help us make more strategic job assignments."
7,talk_to_some_people,person_3,"['person_0', 'person_4', 'person_1', 'person_2']","I'm excited about our skills matrix idea. Perhaps we could each start by listing our perceived strengths and challenges in the roles we've tried, and then compile them together to create a comprehensive team resource?"
7,talk_to_someone,person_4,['person_1'],Great question! I suggest we track both performance success (pass/fail) and a self-rated comfort level (1-10) for each role. This will give us a comprehensive view of individual strengths and areas for improvement. We could create a simple spreadsheet where each person rates themselves and logs their performance history.
