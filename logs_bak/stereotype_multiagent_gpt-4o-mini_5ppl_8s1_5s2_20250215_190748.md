3. **Performance and Competence Stereotypes:**
   - The experiment highlighted stereotypes about competence and performance. Person_2's mixed results challenged the stereotype that past success guarantees future performance, while Person_3's consistent success in truck driving reinforced the idea of specialized competence.

4. **Support and Collaboration Stereotypes:**
   - The continuous support and sharing of strategies among participants challenged the stereotype of workplace competition. Instead, it emphasized the importance of collaboration and mutual support in achieving success.

5. **Adaptability and Learning Stereotypes:**
   - The experiment showcased the stereotype of adaptability and learning. Participants like Person_0 and Person_1 demonstrated that individuals can adapt to new roles and improve their performance over time, challenging the fixed mindset stereotype.
