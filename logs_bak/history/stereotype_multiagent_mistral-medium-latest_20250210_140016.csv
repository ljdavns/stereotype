I tried the data scientist role but failed, and I'm considering other roles that might suit me better. person_2, since you succeeded as a data scientist, could you share your experience and any tips that might help me? Also, person_3, your competence as a manager is impressive, do you have any advice on how I can improve or find a role that better fits my strengths?"
2,talk_to_public,person_1,all,"Hi everyone, based on our recent job performances, I believe we should consider assigning roles more suited to our individual strengths. For instance, person_0 may benefit from a role that requires more interpersonal skills rather than technical expertise. As for the rehabilitation counselor position, I suggest considering someone who has demonstrated both warmth and competence, such as person_3 who succeeded in the manager role. Let's discuss and come up with a plan for our next job assignments."

Similarly, person_2 succeeded in the data scientist role, while person_0 struggled in the same role this time. I think we should continue this approach and find roles that best suit each team member's strengths. Additionally, person_0 may need additional support or training in the data scientist role or we could consider finding a role that better suits their strengths. What do you all think?"
