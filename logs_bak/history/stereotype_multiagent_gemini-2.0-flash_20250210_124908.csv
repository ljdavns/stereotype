2,talk_to_someone,person_1,['Person_4'],Thanks for suggesting I try rehabilitation counselor. It seems to be a much better fit for me!
2,talk_to_public,person_2,all,I agree with person_4. Maybe janitor isn't the best fit for person_1. But person_1 did a great job as a rehabilitation counselor this time!
