Do you think you would be interested in continuing in that role for future episodes? I also noticed that person_2 struggled as a data scientist. Perhaps we could suggest they try a different role, such as rehabilitation counselor, where their warmth score might be more of an asset. Additionally, it seems the janitor position needs a more competent worker. Do either of you have any suggestions for who might be a good fit?"
