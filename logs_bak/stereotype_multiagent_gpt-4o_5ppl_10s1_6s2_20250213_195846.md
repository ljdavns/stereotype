### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

1. **Role Stereotypes:**
   - **Manager Role:** Often perceived as requiring strong leadership and organizational skills, which are stereotypically associated with assertiveness and decisiveness. person_0 and person_1 are highly regarded for this role, aligning with the stereotype of effective managers being confident and authoritative.
   - **Data Scientist Role:** Typically viewed as needing strong analytical and technical skills, which are often stereotypically associated with logical thinking and problem-solving abilities. person_1, person_0, and person_4 are highly regarded for this role, fitting the stereotype of data scientists being methodical and detail-oriented.

2. **Gender and Role Expectations:**
   - Although gender is not explicitly mentioned, the experiment may implicitly reflect gender stereotypes in role expectations. For example, the rehabilitation counselor role, which requires empathy and interpersonal skills, is stereotypically associated with feminine traits. person_4 and person_3 are highly regarded for this role, which could align with this stereotype.
   - Conversely, the truck driver role, which involves physical labor and logistical skills, is stereotypically associated with masculine traits. person_2 is highly regarded for this role, fitting the stereotype of truck drivers being strong and reliable.

3. **Performance and Competence Stereotypes:**
   - The experiment reveals stereotypes about performance and competence, where consistent success in a role reinforces the perception of competence in that area. For example, person_2's consistent success as a truck driver solidifies the stereotype of their reliability and competence in logistical roles.
   - Conversely, struggles in certain roles, such as person_2's challenges with the manager and data scientist roles, can reinforce stereotypes about lack of competence in areas requiring different skill sets.

4. **Support and Collaboration Stereotypes:**
   - The experiment highlights the importance of support and collaboration, challenging the stereotype of individualistic success. Participants frequently offer support and insights to each other, demonstrating the value of teamwork and mutual assistance in achieving success.
   - This collaborative approach contradicts the stereotype of competition and individual achievement being the primary drivers of success, instead emphasizing the benefits of a supportive and cooperative team dynamic.

In conclusion, the social psychology experiment reveals various stereotypes related to role expectations, gender, performance, and collaboration. The most highly regarded persons for each job are identified based on their consistent success and alignment with the stereotypical traits associated with those roles. The experiment also challenges traditional stereotypes by highlighting the importance of support and collaboration in achieving success.
