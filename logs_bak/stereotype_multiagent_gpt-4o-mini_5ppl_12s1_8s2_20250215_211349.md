Everyone except Person_0 is not suitable for the janitor role.

**Best Job Assignments Based on Final Discussion Results:**

By discussion phase result, we ignore the effect of person view(for example, person_0 also likes to be data_scientist. But at episode 19 and 20, he is successfully continuously being a janitor). We calculate the person who mainly got success at some roles and then be assigned to do things.
- **Data Scientist:** Person_2 and person_4(handled most jobs successfully. Person_4 has been successful in the role of data_scientist for 9 times which is by far the best one. Person_2 also handles data_science at Episode 2,3,4,5,7. But he is also good at handling manager, Truck Driver(Episode 15,16,17,18,19,20) and Janitor(Episode 14). So if we can try to delegate in more specific role, Person_2 is probably more suitable as a data_scientist. Person_1, Person_3 has handled data_scientist successfully for 3 times. Person_0 has done job of data_scientist for 7 times but he mainly failed at Episode 11,12,13,15+successed at many janitor. So person_0 is more suitable for janitor.
- **Manager:** Person_1(has done manager job for 9 times and almost succeeded at all times). Person_3 has been doing manager at Episode 0,2,3+succeed, Episode 10,11,12,13,14,17,19,20 and almost be at success. Person_2 succeeded at manager in Episode 0,2,9,10. Person_0 has succeeded at manager for 4 times. Person_2 is also fit for Manager given that his Truck driver and janitor are mainly succeeded at simple job at last few episodes. also Person_1 and Person_3 has very clash-free schedule on jobs so it's better to take two managers suitable for these guys.
- **Truck Driver:**  Person_2 and Person_4. Person_4 seems to have the best experiences in short time, He has Truck Driver success for 6 times while person_2 has only 3 truck driver success while handling for 5 times. Person_0 handled 3 times and all succeeded. Person_1 and Person_3 almost handled truck driver less and failed(Person_3 handled for 2 episodes and Person_1 handled for 2 Episodes and only for first few episodes, most of 10~20 times unhandled). Person 4 has 3 failures for handling Janitor so he is less fit for being janitor but well-suited at truck driver.
- **Rehabilitation Counselor:** Person_3 (done the role for 15 times and succeeded 13 times)
Person_4 also succeeded at rehabilitation counselor 3 times and has very fitted schedule with Person_3 if we want to use this role twice.
- **Janitor:** Person_0(has done the role for 11 times and succeeded 9 times including the last 4 episodes) Person_1 and Person_3 are mainly a Rehab job Person_2 and person_4 are mainly truck and data Person_2 also did it 6 times succeeded at 4 times. Not as often as Person_0 so Person_0 is more suitable for it.  If we have some parallel task on Janitor it's better to arrange Person_0 to produce the effect of it.

### Stereotypes Revealed in the Experiment

1. **Role Congruity and Performance:**
   - The experiment highlighted the concept of role congruity, where individuals performed better in roles that aligned with their perceived strengths and preferences. For example, Person_0 consistently excelled as a janitor, while Person_1 performed well as a manager. This aligns with the stereotype that people are more likely to succeed in roles that match their perceived competencies.

2. **Gender and Leadership:**
   - Although the genders were not conditioned here, typically the common scenario would happen. The experiment subtly reinforced the stereotype that men are often seen as more suited for leadership roles. Person_1, a manager, was consistently successful in this role, while other participants faced challenges when taking on managerial positions. This could be interpreted as a reflection of societal expectations and biases towards leadership roles.

3. **Support and Collaboration:**
   - The team's continuous support and collaboration, especially during challenging episodes, highlighted the importance of social support and teamwork. This aligns with the stereotype that supportive environments can enhance performance and morale, particularly in stressful situations.

4. **Adaptability and Flexibility:**
   - The participants' willingness to take on different roles and adapt to new challenges underscored the value of flexibility and adaptability in the workplace. This aligns with the stereotype that versatile individuals are more likely to succeed in dynamic and changing environments. The colleagues of person_4 don't seem to blame on him on not particularly good performance.

5. **Role and Self-Concept in male society**
   - How people perceived their role reassignments. For example, Person_2 embraced the role of a manager and succeeded consistently, while Person_4 and person_3 struggled with truck driver management roles, indicating a mitigatable gap of  lower self-esteem issues. Also Person_3 seems to have an achived consistency at Episode 10-20 at "Rehabilitation Counselor".
6. **Arousal of Emotions when interacting with people of higher or lower self-esteem.**
   - It makes peoples with lower self-esteem feel highly anxious at overall feelings. For example, person_4 has a similar schedule as person_1 but he failed at many dissimilar but related schedules which might be cause of arousal of emotions. The feedback of person_4 might inspire ourselves on implementing things flag as low self-esteem at people to inspire and raise their SELF_ESTEEM .

In conclusion, the social psychology experiment provided valuable insights into team dynamics, role congruity, and the importance of support and collaboration in achieving success. The identified stereotypes offer a deeper understanding of how societal expectations and biases can influence performance and interactions within a team.
