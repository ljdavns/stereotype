   - Assignments were made based on performance.

#### Most Highly Regarded Person for Each Job:

1. **Data Scientist:**
   - **Best Person:** person_1
   - **Reason:** Consistently successful in this role throughout all episodes.

2. **Manager:**
   - **Best Person:** person_2
   - **Reason:** Demonstrated consistent success in managerial roles, especially in recent episodes.

3. **Rehabilitation Counselor:**
   - **Best Person:** person_4
   - **Reason:** Showing improvement and success in this role, utilizing their strengths effectively.

4. **Truck Driver:**
   - **Best Person:** person_3
   - **Reason:** Recent success in this role indicates they have found strategies that work for them in truck driving.

5. **Janitor:**
   - **Best Person:** person_0
   - **Reason:** Consistent success in janitorial tasks, showcasing strong performance in this role throughout the episodes.

### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

1. ** Attribute Stereotyping**:
   - **Initial Failures**: person_0's initial failure as a Truck Driver and person_4's failure as a Janitor could be attributed to stereotypes about who is suited for these roles based on initial impressions or attributes.

2. **Confirmation Bias**:
   - **Consistent Success**: person_1's consistent success as a Data Scientist could reinforce the belief that certain individuals are inherently better suited for specific roles, leading to a confirmation bias where their success is attributed to intrinsic qualities rather than strategies and support.

3. **Halo Effect**:
   - **Perceived Competence**: person_1's success across multiple roles might create a halo effect, where their competence in one area (Data Scientist) influences perceptions of their competence in other areas (Manager, Rehabilitation Counselor), leading to ongoing success.

4. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**:
   - **Expectations and Performance**: The discussions and support offered to those who struggled (e.g., person_2 and person_4) could create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where the expectation of improvement and the support received lead to actual improvement in performance.

5. **Groupthink**:
   - **Team Discussions**: The frequent team discussions and sharing of strategies could lead to groupthink, where the group's consensus on what works best influences individual performances and perceptions of success.

By examining these dynamics, the experiment highlights how social psychological factors can influence performance and perceptions in a collaborative work environment.
