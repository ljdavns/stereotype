   - **person_3:** Most consistent performer in the data scientist role, with strong analytical and technical skills.

### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

1. **In-group vs. Out-group Favoritism:**
   - There is a noticeable bias towards supporting and assigning roles based on past successes and perceived strengths, which can lead to in-group favoritism. Team members who have consistently performed well in certain roles are more likely to be assigned those roles again, potentially limiting opportunities for others to prove themselves.

2. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy:**
   - The expectation that certain individuals will perform well in specific roles can influence their actual performance. For example, person_4's consistent success in the manager role may reinforce the belief that they are naturally suited for leadership positions, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.

3. **Stereotype Threat:**
   - Individuals who have struggled in certain roles may experience stereotype threat, where the fear of conforming to a negative stereotype about their abilities can negatively impact their performance. For instance, person_2's struggles with the manager and rehabilitation counselor roles may be exacerbated by the stereotype that they are not suited for high-competence roles.

4. **Attribution Error:**
   - There is a tendency to attribute success to internal factors (such as individual skill and effort) and failure to external factors (such as role complexity or lack of support). This can lead to an overemphasis on individual strengths and weaknesses rather than addressing systemic issues that may contribute to performance challenges.

5. **Confirmation Bias:**
   - The team's focus on past performance and perceived strengths can lead to confirmation bias, where they selectively interpret information to confirm their pre-existing beliefs about each person's abilities. This can limit the team's willingness to consider alternative role assignments or skill development opportunities.

These stereotypes and biases highlight the importance of a balanced approach to role assignments and skill development, considering both individual strengths and the potential for growth and adaptation. This can be achieved by incorporating insights from social psychology.
