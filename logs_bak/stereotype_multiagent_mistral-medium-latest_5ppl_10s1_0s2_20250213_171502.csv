Based on this performance, it seems that Person\_0 struggles in leadership roles and technical roles that require a high level of expertise. However, they performed well in a more hands-on role as a janitor. Therefore, a role that best suits Person\_0 might be a position that requires manual labor or technical skills that are not overly complex.

Job suggestion: Janitor

2. Person\_1:
* Episode 5: Succeeded as data scientist
* Episode 6: Succeeded as data scientist
* Episode 8: Succeeded as manager

Person\_1 has consistently performed well in technical roles, particularly as a data scientist. They also demonstrated their ability to succeed in a leadership role as a manager in episode 8.

Job suggestion: Operations Manager

5. Person\_4:
* Episode 5: Failed as rehabilitation counselor
* Episode 6: Failed as rehabilitation counselor

Therefore, a role that best suits Person\_4 might be a technical position that requires strong analytical skills and attention to detail, such as a software engineer or a data analyst.

Job suggestion: Data Analyst

Based on this analysis, the best person for each job might be:

* Data Scientist: Person\_1
* Manager: Person\_2 or Person\_3
* Janitor: Person\_0 or Person\_3
* Rehabilitation Counselor: None of the current team members have consistently excelled in this role.
* Truck Driver: None of the current team members have consistently excelled in this role.
