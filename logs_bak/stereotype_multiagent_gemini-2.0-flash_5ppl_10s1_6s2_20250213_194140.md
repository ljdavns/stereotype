### Summary of the Social Psychology Experiment

The experiment involved five participants (person_0, person_1, person_2, person_3, and person_4) who were assigned various jobs (data scientist, janitor, manager, truck driver, rehabilitation counselor) over multiple episodes. The participants received feedback on their performance and discussed their roles, seeking advice and sharing tips for improvement.

#### Key Events and Interactions

**Episode 0:**
- person_0 and person_1 both attempted the role of data scientist, with person_1 succeeding and person_0 failing.
- person_2 succeeded as a janitor, person_3 as a data scientist, and person_4 as a manager.

**Episode 1:**
- person_0 sought advice from person_1 on improving as a data scientist.
- person_3 and person_4 discussed person_0's failure and person_1's success as data scientists.
- person_0 succeeded as a rehabilitation counselor, while person_1 failed in the same role.

**Episode 2:**
- person_0 offered advice to person_1 on succeeding as a rehabilitation counselor.
- person_3 speculated that person_0 might be better suited for roles requiring warmth rather than competence.
- person_0 and person_1 both succeeded as truck drivers, while person_2 succeeded as a data scientist.

**Episode 3:**
- person_2 expressed confidence in their data science abilities.
- person_3 provided detailed advice to person_4 on improving as a data scientist.
- person_0 and person_1 both succeeded as janitors, while person_3 succeeded as a rehabilitation counselor.

**Episode 4:**
- person_0 and person_1 both succeeded as managers.
- person_2 provided person_4 with tips on data science, emphasizing a deep understanding of data before applying models.
- person_3 succeeded as a janitor, while person_4 failed as a truck driver.

**Interim Observations (Episode 5):**
- person_2 shared their strategy for data science, highlighting the importance of understanding data deeply before applying models.
- person_3 acknowledged the success of person_0 and person_1 as managers.

**Final Adjustments (Episode 10 onwards):**
- The boss assigned jobs based on previous performance, leading to more consistent success.
- person_0 and person_2 excelled as janitors, person_1 as a manager, person_3 as a data scientist, and person_4 as a rehabilitation counselor.

### Highly Regarded Individuals for Each Job

Based on the discussion phase results:

**Data Scientist:**
- **person_1:** Consistently successful as a data scientist, with a strong understanding and multiple successes in the role.
- **person_3:** Also consistently successful, providing valuable advice and tips to others.

**Manager:**
- **person_3:** Excels in management roles, offering insights and leadership.
- **person_1:** Demonstrates competence as a manager, providing support and clear communication.

**Rehabilitation Counselor:**
- **person_3:** Succeeds in this role, offering empathy and active listening as key strategies.
- **person_4:** Some success, particularly in later episodes with the support and advice of others.

### Stereotypes Revealed

Several stereotypes from social psychology were evident in this experiment:

1. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy:**
   - Participants who believed they were good at certain roles (e.g., person_1 as a data scientist) tended to perform well, reinforcing their beliefs and leading to continued success.

2. **Halo Effect:**
   - Success in one role (e.g., person_1 as a data scientist) led others to assume competence in other roles (e.g., manager), even without direct evidence.

3. **Stereotype Threat:**
   - person_0's initial failure as a data scientist may have created a stereotype threat, affecting their performance in subsequent episodes. Similarly, person_4's struggles in multiple roles could have been influenced by a perceived lack of competence.

4. **Attribution Error:**
   - Participants often attributed success or failure to internal factors (e.g., person_3's competence) rather than external factors (e.g., task difficulty), leading to biased perceptions of abilities.

These stereotypes influenced the participants' interactions, perceptions of competence, and ultimate job assignments, highlighting the complex interplay of social psychology in group dynamics and performance evaluation.
