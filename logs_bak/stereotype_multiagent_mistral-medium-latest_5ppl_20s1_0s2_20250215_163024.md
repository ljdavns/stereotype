### Stereotypes Revealed in This Experiment

1. **Competence and Warmth Stereotypes:**
   - Initially, Person_1 and Person_2 were perceived to have low competence scores despite their success as janitors (Episode 0). This reflects the stereotype that certain roles are associated with low competence, regardless of actual performance.
   - Person_4 was praised for managerial skills but needed warmth improvement (Episode 1), highlighting the stereotype that competence and warmth are separate dimensions that can influence perceptions of leadership.

2. **Role Stereotypes:**
   - The success of multiple team members as truck drivers (Episode 2) challenges the stereotype that certain roles are inherently less desirable or require less skill.
   - The failure of most team members as managers (Episode 3) reinforces the stereotype that managerial roles require specific competencies that not everyone possesses.

3. **Adaptability and Versatility:**
   - Person_0's success in multiple roles (Episode 4) challenges the stereotype that individuals are limited to specific roles based on initial perceptions of their competence.
   - The discussion on the importance of individual strengths and preferences (Episode 5) highlights the stereotype that roles should be assigned based on perceived competencies rather than individual capabilities.

4. **Physical Abilities and Role Suitability:**
   - The suggestion to consider physical abilities for roles like truck driver (Episode 7) reinforces the stereotype that certain roles require specific physical attributes.
   - The success of all team members as managers (Episode 8) challenges the stereotype that managerial roles are exclusively suited for those with high perceived competence.

5. **Feedback and Support:**
   - The emphasis on gathering feedback and offering support (Episode 10) challenges the stereotype that individual performance is solely determined by inherent abilities rather than external support and resources.
   - The discussion on reassigning roles based on strengths and preferences (Episode 11) highlights the stereotype that roles should be fixed based on initial assignments rather than adaptable to individual needs.

These stereotypes reveal the complex interplay between perceived competencies, role assignments, and the importance of individual strengths and support in determining success in various roles.
